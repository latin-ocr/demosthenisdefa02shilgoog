DEMOST HEN IS

πον· ἦν. ἐνταῦθ’ ἐγκαλεῖ τις Αἰσχίνῃ; βούλεταί τις·
τούτου κατηγορεῖν περὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ πραχ--

θέντων ; οὐδὲ εἷς.

οὐκοῦν περὶ τούτων γε ἀφεῖται, 105

τουμένων καὶ τοὺς μάρτυρας παρέχεσθαι καὶ τὰ τεκ-
μήρια δεῖ λέγειν τὸν φεύγοντα, ού τὰ ὁμολογούμενα

ἀπολογούμενον ἐξαπατᾶν.

ὅπως τοίνυν περὶ τοῦ πο-

λέμου μηδὲν ἐρεῖς· οὐδεὶς γὰρ οὐδὲν αἰτιᾶται περὶ αύ-

example, we were at war with
Philip: so we were. Does any
one herein accuse Aeschines?’'
The sentence at the beginning
of ἓ 106 is parallel, so that ii it
iil not interrogative, neither is
t ‘s.

ς 105. περὶ γὰρ τῶν ἀμφισβ]
“ For it is on controverted
points that the defendant should
bring forward his witnesses and
state the grounds from which
you are to draw your conclu-
sions‚ not by defending himself
on points admitted to be true to
yain an acquittal.'' So I trans-
late the last words, for ἐξαπατᾶν
is particularly used of misle-ad-
1119, humbuyyiny a jury. Thus,
when Philocleon has put the
ψῆφος into the wrong um, Arist.
Vesp. 992, his son exclaims
ἐξηπάτηται κάπολέλυκεν οὐχ ἑκών.
For the usage oi the word in
Demosthenes, it is sufficient to
compare Pantaenet. p. 980,
where three examples are found
in as many lines. τὸ. ὁμολογ.

ἀπολογ. might be rendered
‘⁴ bringing forward in his de-
fence admitted points,” “rest-
ing his defence on admitted
points:” and as far as idiom is
concerned‚ this is the ordinary
meaning of ἀπολογεῖσθαι with
the accusative: but the context ·
seems to require the other trans-
lation, and we find in Macart.

tive would have been more
usual [οὐδὲ πρὸς πολλοστὸν Cobet.

This also Cobet will not leave

alone, first (Var. Lect. p. 273)
replacing μέμψεται. . . ἀπολογήσε-
ται, “ secundis curis ’' ἀπολύσεται
(Var. Lect. p. 368). It may be
observed that excusare with an
accusative has the double mean-
·ing. ordinary dictionaries will
furnish example& .
