APPENDIX O. 285

have arisen from the use of the negative, like our ‘ nay,'
immo, or anzi (ante) in Italian? which are negative in-
asmuch as they object to the preceding phrase as not
being strong enough, whilst they agree with its general
meaning, and enhance its force? Certainly in these cases

the negative and affirmative senses often approach very .

near to one another, as, for instance, in the following
passage of B. Jonson: ‘ A good man often profits by his
endeavour, yea, when absent3 way, when dead, by his
example and memory.' ''

There appears to 1116 to be great truth in this remark.
However, I have at present nothing to do with the
investigation of the Latin ne, or the English my, but
will endeavour, from the Greek authors, to ascertain the
meaning of ναί. Ι have observed in the Orators the
following passages, Dem. de Ceron. p. 310 §251 ναί,
φησίν· α’,λλοὶ τό τοῦ Κεφάλου καλόν, τό μηδεμίαν γραφήν
φυγεῖν. Aristocr. Ρ. 652 ἓ 96 ναί· *rt-&53 ε’γῶ διδάξω.
[Dem.] Aristog. p. 791 ἓ 72 ναί, φησίν· ἀδίκως γάρ μ’
ἐγγέγραφεν. Pantaenet. 977 ἓ 36 ναί, φησίν· ἀλλὰ κᾶν
ἄλλο τι ἀδικῇ τις περὶ τοὶ μέταλλα, καὶ τούτων εἰσὶ δίκαι.
Α68ο11111. de Ceron. §28 p 57 St.=- 423 R. ναί· ἀλλ’ ἅντι-
διαπλέκει πρὸς τοῦτο εὐθὺς ὥς οὔτ’ ἔλαχε τειχοποιος οὔτ’
ἐχειροτονήθη ὖπό τοῦ δήμου. ἓ 48 Ρ. 60 = 437 ναί· εἴ γε’ σε’
τις ἄλλη πόλις στεφανοῖ· εἰ δὲ ὅ δῆμος ὅ Ἀθηναίων. ἓ 84
Ρ. 65 = 478 ναί· ἀλλὰ χαλκοῖς καὶ ἀδαμαντίνοις τείχεσιν, ὥς
αὐτός φησι, τήν χώραν ἡμῶν ἐτείχισε. Dinarch. ο. Demosth.
ἓ 7 Ρ. 91 St. = 6 R. ναί· κατέψευσται γὰρ ἦ βουλὴ Δημο-
σθένους. 111 6111311686 passages I conceive it will be granted
that ναί 1168 at least a quasi-ozeqative meaning, answering
to our ‘⁴ nay;'' and in fact does not 80 much serve the pur-
pose of affirminq the precedinq position, aa of uskem‘nq
in the subsequam objection.

I now come to the use of the word in other writers.
It occurs ,in Homer’s Iliad seven times: 1. 234 ναὶ μοὶ
