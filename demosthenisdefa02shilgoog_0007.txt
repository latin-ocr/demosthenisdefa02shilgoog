MY DEAR SIR,

I am highly gratified in being permitted
to dedicate this Volume to you, one of the most dis-
tinguished Pupils of our common Master‚ Samuel,
sometime Lord Bishop of Lichfield.

I had the good fortune to commence my aca-
demical career under your Tuition before higher
duties called you from Trinity College. My recol-
lections of that period, and more enlarged experience
since, assure me that I cannot usher this Edition
into the world under more favourable auspices than
the sanction of your name: and I most gladly em-
brace the opportunity now afforded me of expressing
at once the high esteem which, in common with all,

I entertain towards you, and'my grateful sense of
your unvaried kindness.

Believe me to remain,
My dear Sir,
Ever yours most faithfully,
⁴ RIOHARD SHILLETO.

Cumanum,
November 28, 1844.
