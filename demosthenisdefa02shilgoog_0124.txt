Αἰσχίνῃ τούτῳ, καὶ πολλὴν κακίαν ἐχόντων, ὦς καὶ
ὑμῖν οἴομαι δοκεῖν, οὐδέν ἐστιν οὗ μέλλω λέγειν, ὥς

ἐγὼ κρίνω, δεινότερον, οὐδ’ ὅ τι μᾶλλον ἐπ’ αὐτοφώρῳ
δεδωροδοκηκότ’ αὐτὸν καὶ πεπρακότα πάντ’ ἐξελέγξει.
ἐπειδὴ ’γὰρ ἀπεστέλλετ’ αὖθις αὖ τὸ τρίτον τοὺς πρέσ-

(Valesius gives 811 example of
11118 from Xenop h. Hellen.
1. vii. 23 where 1118 three- sold
division is somewhat differ·
ently stated.) 'l'he same is
found in Suidas in διαμ. ἠμ.
and in Ποσειδεών. The expres·
sion is understood to signify

“ πρὸς κλεψύδραν, or πρὸς ὕδωρ,

and appears to relate to the

tried in Ποσειδεών, 88 we are
led todnser from Harpocration's
words, I do not see. Was the
present action brought in that
