Why the two unfortunate words
ἢ μετειληφὼς are rejected 1 am
at a loss to understand. We
have already seen (ς 184) that
Philip’s first idea was to bribe
the ambassadors separately: ἐ-

or Herm. Manual 5 154, n. 8.
The λογισταὶ are thought to have
been a superior board, to whom
the εὔθυνοι were a sort of assess-
ore. The authority for the dif-
ference between the two boards
is Arist. ap. Harpocration: διεί-
