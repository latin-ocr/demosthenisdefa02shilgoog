ὑπερβάλλοντα, ἂν δι’ εὐήθειαν ἢ δι’ ἄλλην ἄγνοιαν
ἡντινοῦν λελυμασμένος φανῇ. ἂν μέντοι διὰ πονηρίαν
ἀργύριον λαβὼν καὶ δῶρα, καὶ τοῦτ’ ἐξελεγχθῇ σαφῶς
ὑπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν πεπραγμένων, μάλιστα μέν, εἰ οἷόν τε,
ἀποκτείνατε, εἰ δὲ μή, ζῶντα τοῖς λοιποῖς παράδειγμα
ποιήσατε. σκοπεῖτε δὴ τὸν ὑπὲρ τούτων ἔλεγχον, ὠς

δίκαιος ἔσται, μεθ’ ὑμῶν.

ς 116. “Yet (unsatisfactory
as this plea is) remit in favour
of Aeschines these dreadful and
excessivo crimes‚'' i.e. do not
punish him for, but¹ bestow
your grace upon him. It is well
expressed in the Latin version:
condonate Aeschini atrocia ista
et immensa. So Nicostr. p. 1247
§2 τὰ μὲν τρία μέρη...τῇ πόλει
ἀφίημι, whieh Reiske translates
remitto atque condono. So μεθιέ-
ναι in Hom. 11. 1. 283 λίσσομ’
Ἀχιλλῆϊ μεθέμεν χόλον. See
Brunck on Arist. Ran- 851.
Pors. on Eur. Orest. 663 cites
Rollin’s translation iram contra
Achillem tuam dimittas with
apparent assent. (Ι should pre-
fer iram tuam Achilli (in Achil-
lis qratiam) remitte. If ’Δχιλλῆϊ
belongs to χόλον, why not qeni-

but) “ i‘n favour of.” σκοπεῖ-
τε ...... μεθ’ ὑμῶν] Ι cannot reoal
to memory another instance of
this usage of μετά, though it
answers to the Latin vobiscum,
and (apparently) to our with
your-selvas. The usual idiom
after σκοπεῖσθαι, λογίζεσθαι, &0-

 

is ‘rap’ ὑμῖν or πρὸς ὑμᾶς.

§117 ...... 120. Aeschines ei-
ther was deoeived himself, or
purposely deceived you. If he
were deceived, it must be owing
to one of two causes: either
that he heard Philip making in
distinct and express terms th ese
ffissffisszzffizffflzffiffl
bland courtesy. On either sup-
position he, of all men in the
world, ought to detest Philip.
Does he ever stand iorward as
accuser oi Philip? Does he
tell you how he has been im-
posed upon, and bid you beware
of Philip? No: he was not
deceived‚ he was not imposed
upon, he was Philip’s hireling.
--διαῤῥήδην ...... ὑποσχομένου]
These words are to be joined:
διαῤῥήδην ἀκοὺειν is too violent a
confusion of metaphor to be
good Greek. The collocation is
for the sake of emphasis, as
