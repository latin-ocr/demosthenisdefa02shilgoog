told you that in my lecture
last Thursday? ’ Here also Greek
und English idioms agree. If
he referred to past time indefi-
nuely, he would use our perfect.
⁴‘ Ι have often, already, more
than once, told you so.’' Here
the Greeks occasionally use the
perfect (e.g. Arist. Equjt. 1290 ἤ
πολλάκις ἐννυχίαισι Ι φροντίσι συγ-
ῪεγένημαιΙ καὶ διεζήτησα κ.τ.λ.)
but much more frequently the
aorist. [Both are joined in
Leptin. p. 458 ἓ 3 πολλάκις...
κεχειροτονήκατε ..... ἤδη . . .. . ἐπείσ-
θητε.] Even here the genius of
our language does not utterly
esohew the indefinite tense. Ι
notieed this idiom several years
ago in Dugald Stewart. ‘⁸ Ι be-
fore observed’' Philosophy of
the Human Mina, Vol. 1. p. 303.
Ed. 5. Lond. 1814. “I had
occasion already to hint'' p. 81.
“ It was already remarked’' p.
437. (Of already so used Ι find
noted down in my copy Vol. 1.

exampleS.) 'I'he truth ie, that
when the lecturer’s thought re-
‚verte to time past whether defi-
nite or indefinite, he does not
simply remember that he has
said this or that, but that there
was a time (were times) when he
said this or that. The readerwill
see that in Ann. Orit. Ι do not
adopt Schaefer’s ‘ ‘aoristus induit
naturam perfeeti‚'’ my words
being, “naturam perfecti quo-
dam modo induere videtur.” I
believe the “natures” of the
Greek perfect and aoriet to be
as distinet as the “natumst'' of
the English definite preterite and
indefinite preterite. [This addi-
tional matter has been elicited
by a note in Mr Oope's Preface
to his Translation of Plato’s
Gorgias (p. xvi.). To his friend·
ship Ι am indebted for a copy
of the work, which ouriously
reached me at the very time
when Ι was revising this sheet
for the prees, Ed. 111.]
