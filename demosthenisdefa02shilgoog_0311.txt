In Ι infer, then, that ναὶ is fundamentally connected

with a negative idea: that its affirmative usage is purely
accidental¹, and always, when so employed, serves to
strengthen the words coming from 1118 preceding speaker,
by way of taking an obj ection to their sufficiency: that
in a considerable number of instances the negative idea
predominates: and that in the 0181818, 81 any rate, it is
never met with in a strictly affirmative signification.
The last remark will of course be confirmed, or rectified,
by examples which I shall feel thankful to be furnished
with: for Ι hold myself a lover of truth and for truth’s
sake, and am wishful to adopt as my motto the words of
Socrates with reference to this question or any opinion

ἢ ἄλλον ἀπαλλάξαι. (Plat. Gorg. 458 A.)²
