Vfflous constructions after words of fearinq are ex-
amined by Hermann on Viger‚ n. 265, with his usual
minuteness and refinement‚ though he has left some un-
notic'ed. The mood ordinarily used, inasmuch as to fhar
properly implies a‘ future idea, is the subjunctive. But,
as in our own idiom “I fear you have mistaken the
meaning,'' intends to convey no doubt or uncertainty as
to the fact having occurred, but is merely expressive of
courtesy on the part of the speaker, so in Greek also
instances of an indicative are not unusual. We find
therefore many constructions: (1) δέδοικα μή ποιῇς. (2)
δ. μὴ ποιήσῃς. (3) ὃ. μὴ ποιεῖς. (4) ὃ. μή ἐποίεις. (5) ὃ.
μὴ ἐποίησας. (6) δ. μὴ πεποίηκας, and ev‘en in relation bo
a future action, (7) δέδοικα μὴ ποιήσεις. l and 2 corre-
spond respectively to vereor ne facias, and vereor ne ficaria .-
for 3, 4, 5, and 6, the Latins have no distinctive mode of
expression, since from other causes their subjunctive must
necessarily be used: ’ἴ may be translated vereo'r ne factu-
rus sie. It is not very easy to explain the distinction in
our own language: 1. “I sear that you are on the point
of doing it,” which is used to express an uncertainty
whether the event is on the point of being done, but a
probability that it is. 2. “I am afraid that you will do
it.'' 3.‘ ‘I am afraid that you are doing it:'' to use a
familiar illustration, if a person is transcribing any
writing‚ and I look over his shoulder and see him mis-
