house.’' But Xenophon's use
of a word is frequently different
from Attic usage, as Elmsl. on
Heracl. 404, Cobet, Var. Lect.
p. 324, 325 (and elsewhere),
justly remark. οἰκία invariably
means ‘⁴ the dwelling-house,”
or the “house ’' in the sense
in which we say “Home of
Stuart,” “House of Brunswick.”

(who refers to Eur. Heracl. 575,
Ar. Equit. 415 τοσοῦτος ἐκτρα-
φείην, and other passages) to
take it as a predicate ‘⁴ brought
them up to be such swells.''

παιδὸς ἔχων. The father of
Aeschines, Atrometus, connect-
ed with the old sacrificial family
the Ἐτεοβουτάδαι, was still
alive at the advanced age of 94.
He had suffered exile under
the Thirty, and during that

general wreek (for an account
whereof, see Demosth. Eubulid.
p. 1309 ἓ 35 foll. and Xenoph.
Memor. 11. 7) had lost all his
fortunes. See Aeschin. p. 47
St. = 313 R. Demosthenes,
however, de Coron. p. 270 ἓ 129
soll„ tells another story: viz,
that Tromoe (for such was the
original name) was a slave of
one Elpias a pedagogus, and as
Aeschines advanced in station,
he, by the addition of two syl·
lables, furnished his father
with the more dignified name
of Atrometus. From the same
passage and below ξ 322 we
leam his mother’s name, Glau-
eothea.——''pr] de Coron. p.

Καλαμίτης appears to have been
a by-word for ἰατρός, from tho
