286 APPENDIX O.

τόδε σκῆπτρον. 1. 286 ναὶ δὴ ταῦτα’. γε πάντα, γέρον, nard.
μοῖραν ἔειπες, which line recurs with the necessary varia·
tion, v111. 146, X. 169, XXIII. 626, XX1v. 379, and xv1115
128 ναὶ δή ταῦτά γε, τέκνον, ἐτήτυμον, which is very simi-
lar. In the Odyssey we meet with it four times (in all
a repetition of Il. 1. 286), IV. 266, XVIII. 170, XX. 37,
XXII. 486. It appears in the Hymn to Mercury 460 ναὶ -
μοὶ τόδε κρανέῖνον ἀκόντιον. Thus in the twelve passages
from the writings ascribed to Homer, twice it is joined
with μό, a particle used in swearing, “ N ay by :’' and ten
times in answering, correcting, and paving the way for
a coming objection.

In Aeschylus Ι have observed it only twice: Pers. 7 38
ναί· λόγος κρατεῖ σαφηνὴς τοῦτο κοῦκ ἔνι στάσις, and 1071
ἰαὶ δῆτα ναὶ ναί. The latter passage may safely be left.
In the former the particle is not a mere “ yes:” but cor-
responds to our colloquial “ way, this is quite clear.''

In Sophocles the instances are either in the affirma-
tive reply to a question, Oed. Col. 27, Electr. 845, (and
ναιχὶ Oed. T. 6840 or (as above) used in bringing foi-ward
an objection, Philoct. 372 (quoted on ἓ 118), Trachin. 424
ναί· κλύειν γ’ ἔφασκον. ταῦτὸ δ’ οὐχὶ γίγνεται Ι δόκησιν
εἰπεῖν κάξακριβῶσαι λόγον.

111 Euripides the examples are, as might be expected,
more numerous. I shall refer to such as bear out the
neyative signification of the particle: Med. 1277 ναί, πρὸς
θεῶν, ἆρήξατ’. ἐν (δέοντι> γάρ. Hipp. 605 ναί, πρός σε τῆς
σῆς δεξιᾶς εὗωλένου. Alcest. 1119 ναί, σῶζε νῦν, καὶ τόν
Διός l φήσεις ποτ’ εἶναι παῖδα γενναῖον ξένον. Phoen. 1665
ναί, πρός σε τῆσδε μητρὸς Ἰοκάστης, Κρέον. Iph. Aul. 1247
ναί, πρός γενείου σ’ ἀντόμεσθα δύο φίλοι. Cyclops 147 ναὶ
δὶς τόσον πῶμ’ ὅσον ἂν ἐξ οἷσκοῦ ῥυῇι. In all the above-

1 Hermann reads from con· have not a doubt but that ναὶ
jecture καὶ δὶςτ τόονσ κ..τ λ., with· expresses the same meaning
out any conceivable reason. 1 much more forcibly.
