we are expressly told that De·

low p. 446 5 375 ἐξελήλανται
καὶ ἀνάστατος αὐτῶν ἡ χώρα
γέγονεν. ThuO. VI. 5 καὶ αὖθις
ὑπὸ Γέλωνος ἀνάστατος γενομένη
(ἡ γῆ ἡ Καμαριναίων Β. Καμά-
ρινα). The people oi Halus
were delivered up to the Phar-
salians. See Dem. ad Phil.
Epist. init. Hence Valesius on
Harpocr. (notes on Maussac.

prefers ἀνάσπαστος ‘ ‘ neque enim
verum est Halum eversam fuisse,
cum tradita sit Pharsaliis. ἀνά-
σπαστος autem recte dicitur,
quia ejus incolae omnes abducti
et in servitutem redacti.” He
proves this use of ἀνάσπαστος
from Herodotus [see Schw.
Lexic.] and other writers, But
it has been truly remarked that
as ἐξελήλανται refers to the in-
habitants, so πόλις by contrast
must here mean χώρα, and
Taylor acutely observes, “opta-
verim adductum esse vel uni-
cum saltem locum, ubi πόλις
urbs ipsa aut χώρα ἀνάσπαστος
dicitur. ”-λύσασθαι] Schaefer ε
“ Philippus gratis potuit dimit-
tere eos, qui ipsius mancipia
essent: qui essent alioruin, si
vellet liberare, a dominis redi-
mere debuit pretio soluto, Illos
igitur ἔλυσεν, hos ἐλύσατο. Om-

mosthenes urged upon Philip
to employ the money and pre-
sente which he was offering as
ξένια to himself and his col-
leagues in effecting the ransom
of the captives. Φίλιππον ἀξιοῦν,
ὧν ’ἡμῖν ἐδίδου ξενίων, τούτους (Le.
τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους) λύσασθαι. It
is strange after citing this pas-
sage (where surely Φίλιππον is
the subject to λύσασθαι) how
Boehnecke Forscmmqen p. 405
could fancy that Philip's letter
was worded τοὺς δ’ αἰχμαλώτους
ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς λύσασθαι οὐδ’ ε’·νε·
θυμήθην. It is very easy to con·
ceive that Philip gave up his
own prisoners without ransom,
and so Aeschines 5 100 p. 41
St.=274 R. informs us, but he
could hardly expect that his
allies and others should follow
his example. He had therefore
made a promise that he would
not only set free gratuitously
(λῦσαι) his own prisoners, but
would contribute to the ransom
of such as were in other hands,
Com. 5 185 ἐπειδὴ ταῦτ’ (so.
ξένια) εἰς τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους ἡξίουν
αὐτὸν ἀναλίσκειν ἐγώ. . ,οὔτε φυγεῖν
τὸ ἀνάλωμα (καλῶς εἶχεν)· ὠμο-
λόγησε μὲν δή, διεκρούσατο δὲ εἰς
τοὶ Παναθήναια φήσας ἀποπέμψειν.
(άποπ. what? surely τὰ λύτρα.)
