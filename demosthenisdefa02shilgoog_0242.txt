DEMOSTHENIS

ρους ἔχοντες συμμάχους, μυρίοις δὲ ξένοις καὶ τριήρεσι
πεντήκοντα ὑμῶν βοηθησάντων αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔτι τῶν
πολιτῶν τετρακισχιλίοις, οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς τούτων ἐδυνήθη
σῶσαι, ἀλλὰ πρὶν μὲν ἐξελθεῖν ἐνιαυτὸν τοῦ πολέμου ·
τὰς πόλεις ἁπάσας ἀπολωλέκεσαν τὰς ἐν τῇ Χαλ-

267 κιδικῇ οἱ προδιδόντες, καὶ Φίλιππος οὐκέτ’ εἶχεν ὑπα- 30²

κούειν τοῖς προδιδοῦσιν, οὐδ’ εἶχεν ὅ τι πρῶτον λάβῃ.
πεντακοσίους δ’ ἱππέας προδοθέντας, ὑπ’ αὐτῶν τῶν

...... ἅναξ δ’ ὀ πρέσβυς τόδ’ εἶπε

repetition of ἡγεμὼν ὁ πρέσβυς.
In the latter passage, if τόθεν
must necessarily signify ὅθεν,
which I strongly doubt notwith-
standing PerS. 100, we have a
most natural apodosia in ἔτλα
δ’ οὖν θυτὴρ ’γενέσθαι κ.τ.λ. (224).
But Klausen is a most unsafe
guide: not indeed from ignor-

' ance, but petulant aelf-will: see

his note on Choeph. 348 (368)
where he actually maintains
that μὴ is used for οὐ “ ubicun-
que negatio quaepiam affirmatur
et asseveratur,'’ and for fear
his note should be misunder-
stood or overlooked, translates
in his commentary μηδὲ ...... τέ-
θαψαιε “ne id quidem, sane ne
id quidem nobis contigit, ut
honestam mortem obiret pater.’'
And he is so confident, that he
cares not to bring forward a
single speciem instance to sup·
port him, his quotations being
either mainly from passages
where μὴ is so used aster απ
oath (a peculial-izv which ad-
mits of explanation), or where
μὴ follows ὃς used causall in
the sense of quippe qui. en
an unfortunate person explains

οὐδὲν by μηδαμῶς, one is apt to
laugh at his blunder, and rest
satisfied that he exposes himself
and is unlikely to mislead his
readers: but when an editor of
Klausen’s learning and acute·
ness is so erotchety as to adopt
for his motto ‘⁴ video meliora
proboque: Det-eriora sequor :”
graver feelings naturally ariae,
and in proportion to his merite
his faults deserve severer casti-
gation.—-This statement of the
condition of Olynthus at the
commencement of her war with
Philip is perhaps as exaggerated
as the description of the close
of her struggle with Sparta,
