legitur p. 323, 13” 5 183, where
we are expressly told that De-

low p. 446 ἓ 375 ἐξελήλανται
καὶ ἀνάστατος αὐτῶν ἡ χώρα
γέγονεν. Thuc. VI. 5 καὶ αὖθις
ὑπὸ Γέλωνος ἀνάστατος γενομένη
(ἡ Ὑῆ ἡ Καμαριναίων s. Καμά-
ρινα). The people of Halus
were delivered up to the Phar-
salianS. See Dem. ad Phil.
Epist. init. Hence Valesius on
Harpocr. (notes on Maussac.
adnotat. p. 212--415 Ed. Lips.)
prefers ἀνάσπαστος “neque enim
verum est Halum eversam fuisse,
cum tradita sit Pharsaliis. ἀνά-
σπαστος autem recte dicitur,
quia ejus incolae omnes abducti
etin servitutem redacti.” He
proves this use of ἀνάσπαστος
from Herodotus [see Schw.
Lexic.] and other writers, But
it has been truly remarked that
as ἐξελήλανται refers to the in-
habitants, so πόλις by contrast
must here mean χώρα, and
Taylor acutely observes, “opta-
verim adductum esse vel uni-
cum saltem locum, ubi πόλις
urbs ipsa aut χώρα ἀνάσπαστος
dicitur. ”-λύσασθαι] Schaefer z
‘⁴ Philippus gratis potuit dimit-
tere eos, qui ipsius mancipia
essent: qui essent aliorum, si
vellet liberare, a dominis redi-
mere debuit pretio solut0. Illos
igitur ἔλυσεν, hos ἐλύσατο. Om-

mosthenes urged upon Philip
to employ the money and pre-
sents which he was offering as
ξένια to himself and his col-
leagues in effecting the ransom
of the captives, Φίλιππον α’ξιοῦν,
ὦν ἡμῖν ἐδίδου ξενίων, τούτους (Le.
τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους) λύσασθαι. It
is strange after citing this pas-
{32 <13:322 εἴ)
Boehnecke Forscmmyen p. 405
could fancy that Philip’s letter
was worded τοὺς δ’ αἰχμαλώτους
ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς λύσασθαι οὐδ’ ἑνε-
θυμήθην. It is very easy to con-
ceive that Philip gave up his
own prisoners without ransom,
and so Aeschines ἓ 100 p. 41
St.=274 B. informs uS, but he
could hardly expect that his
allies and others should follow
his example. He had therefore
made a promise that he would
not only set free gratuitously
(λῦσαι) his own prisoners, but
would contribute to the ransom
of such as were in other hands,
Com. ξ 185 ἐπειδὴ ταῦτ’ (sc.
ξένια) εἰς τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους ἠξίουν
αὐτὸν ἀναλίσκειν ἐγώ. . ,οὔτε φυγεῖν
τὸ ἀνάλωμα (καλῶς εἶχεν)· ὠμο·
λόγησε μὲν δή, διεκρούσατο δὲ εἰς
τοί Παναθήναια φήσας ἀποπέμψειν.
(dn-or. what? surely τὰ λύτρα.)
