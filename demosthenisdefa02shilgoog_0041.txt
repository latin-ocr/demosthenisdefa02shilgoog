ματι.] What‘ were the terms of
this resolution (called also δόγμα
συνέδρων, i. e. of the delegates
from the several allied states
present at Athens> may be
gathered from Aeschines, § 60
p. 35 st.=240 R. They pro-
posed to wait till the arrival of
the ambassadors whom Athens
had sent for from the allies,
and then to negotiate respecting
peace with Philip. Yet Demos·
· thenes, we are informed (ἓ 61
Ρ. 36 St. :241 R.·foll.), not only
refused to wait, but introduced
a ψήφισμα treating of alliance as
well as peace with Philip. ‘⁴ The
roceedings of the two assem-

lies on the leth and leth
(Elaphebolion are so distorted
by the contr 'ctory statements
of the rival oratore, that it is
hardly possible to discover the
real course of the debates, or

the proposition of the allies.
The truth evidently lies between

the side of Aeschines.'’ Thirlw.
v. 353, 354. Schaefer's transla-
tion of συμμ. δόγμα (on 385, 25),
decretum de sociis, is obviously
wrong.

ἓ 17. According to his own
statement, which bears internal
evidence of truth, Aeschines
has been greatly misrepresented.
He advised his countrymen to
remember their forefathers’ a-
chievements at Marathon, Sa-
lamis, and Plataea, but at the
same time warned them against
imitating their errors, and that
ill-timed love of strise (τοί ἁμαρ-
τήματα καὶ τήν ἄκαιρον φιλονει-
κίαν), which led them to the fatal
Sicilian expedition in aid of the
Leontines. See ἓ 74 foll. p. 37,
38 St.=253‚ 254 R. That Ae·
schines speaks the truth may
be inserted from the words of
