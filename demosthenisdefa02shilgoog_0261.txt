DE FALSA LEGATIONE.

’βαίνειν εἶς Πειραιᾶ δεῖν ἤδη καὶ χρήματ’ εἰσφέρειν
καὶ τὰ θεωρικὰ στρατιωτικὰ ποιεῖν, ἢ χειροτονεῖν ἃ

συνεῖπε μὲν οὗτος ἔγραψε δ’ὁ βδελυρὸς Φιλοκράτης,

you together with him (i. e. Phi-
lonious); ·” for μετὰ with ‘the
genitive (though rarely, yet)
sometimes refers to the object
and not the subject. In Ar.
Vesp. 1037, which Ι formerly
quoted as an instance, μετ’ αὐ-
τόν Bentley’s alteration is un-
questionably right. The Poet
did not attack Cleon and the
Sophiste in the same play. But

-ἐπειδὴ δέ κ. τ. λ. ]‘ ‘But when
you have terrified these (τουτ-
ουσί, as usual, identifying the
jurors with the whole body oi
the Athenian citizens) and de-
clared they must at once go
down to the Piraeus and con-
tribute a war tax, and convert
the theatrical fund into a mili-
tary fund, else they must vote
for the measure which Aeschines
advocated and Philocrates pro-
posed, whence it turned out that
the peace was concluded on dis-
graceful instead οι honourable

terms &c.’' 1 see no difficulty
in the nomin. pendens in a sen-
tence delivered with such rapid-
ity and vehemence as this. An
instance occurs above § 301.

Resides, though Demosthenes
probably, at the outset of the
sentence, intended to signify
that Eubulus had caused the
{statiis {13⁵⁰ ἱῖἓὲἲῗιῖὶὲἷέ
graceful measure, yet he pru·
dently thought proper to dis-
guise this as he proceeded under
the vaguer language “it so re-
sulted,'’ especially as he oould
then with more weight eontrast
the anti-Macedonio feeling which
Eubulus had or pretended to
have evinced with his becoming
reconciled to and advocating the
Philippising party. δεδιξά-
μενος] This verb (in Attio, and in
the purest authors who wrote
in other dialects) always sig·
nifies “ to frighten, to men·
ace.'’ It is very remarkable that
so many concur in mis-transla-
ting Homer 11. 11. 190 δαιμόνι’ οὐ

especially after Elmsley‚ Edinb.

the proper translation, as a com-
parison with xv. 196 will amply
convince the maden—This

of notice that he was the author
οι that infamous bill, whereby
it was rendered a capital offence
even to propose the alienation
οι the theatrical fund to any
state purposes. Thirlw. v. 300,

ficient influence to repeal this till
Olymp. 110, 2, 339 n.o., a year
before the battle οι Chaeronea.
