διαμαρτύρεσθαι τὸ καθ’ αὑτόν. οὐ τοίνυν πεποὺηκε

ταῦτ’ οὖχὶ βοᾷ καὶ λέγει ’ότι χρήματ’ εἴληφε-ν Αἰσχίνης
καὶ πονηρός ἐστιν ἀργυρίου συνεχῶς, οὐ δι’ ἀβελτερίαν
οὐδὲ δι’ ἄγνοιαν, οὐδ’ ἀποτυγχάνωνς ’
Καὶ τίς μου καταμαρτυρεῖ, φησί, δῶρα λαβεῖν; 130

a bribe should have avoided
most carefully.” ὡμολόγει is
to be retained, because Philo·
crates had gone into exile be-
fore this speech was delivered.
[Voemel agrees with me.] See
§ 124 ὡμολόγει, ἐδείκνυεν.

τρόν] “ For this is h1s splendid
argument.” Observe the arti-
cle joined with the predicate.
‘'‘ This is (κατ’ ἐξοχὴν) λαμπρόν.”
Oomp. p. 430 g 318 where the
words recur though with a
somewhat different application,
Leptin. p. 471 ἓ 47 ἀλλ’ αὐτὸ
δὴ τοῦτο καὶ τὸ δεινόν ἐστιν (the
maxumas mazar&
expressed πῶς οὐχ ὑπέρδεινον
ποιήσομεη), Aristocr. p. 690
ὅ 211 ἀλλ’ οὐ τοῦτ’ ἔστι τὸ
δεινόν, 1. Aphob. p. 825 538.
This usage of the article is
frequent in Plato, when the
argument is in the mouth of a
resolute and overbearing speak-
er, who delivers his opinions
with a determination that his
audience shall accept them.

 

See Gorg. p. ΜΕ where Polus
says ου’κοῦν τοῦτό ἐστὶ τὸ μέγα
δύνασθαις but Socrates imme--
diately after, καὶ τοῦτο καλεῖς
μέγα δύνασθαις So frequently
Callicles in the same dialogue,
e.g. p. 492 Ο τὰ δὲ ἄλλα ταῦτλ
ἐστι τὰ καλλωπίσματα, τὰ παρὰ
{timu συνθήματα, where Hein-
orf wished to omit τὰ· before
καλλ. The words may be aptly·
translated: “ But all things else
are what 1 should call gauds,
what Ι should call things put
together conventionally contra-
ry to the law of naturast The
same dialogue gives an example
very like those quoted from
Demosthenes, p. 511 Β οὐκοῦν
τοῦτο δὴ καὶ τὸ &varanna-<im
τὰ πράγματ’ ......] “The
facts, Aeschines, which are the
most trustworthy of all wit·
nessee‚ and one cannot say of
them or lay to their charge
that either because they have
been bribed or are desirous to
curry favour with some one,
they are such as they are,
