uses the word δούλην (666 § 73), his friend and ally.' ’ But is it

not speaking in his own person,
but selecting the word which
the Persian despot would have
used, or probably did use; cp.
Thucyd. vm. 43 ἐνῆν γὰρ (in the
Lacedaemonian treaties with
Persia) καὶ νήσους ἁπάσας πάλιν
δουλεύειν, partly also perhaps
to make the antithesis more
forcible‚ πάλιν ὑμετέραν δούλην,
τότε σύμμαχον αὑτοῦ. The king
01 Persia had asserted the free-
dom of Amphipolis and taken it
under his protection: he now
restores it to you with all your
sovereign rights over it. We
must not forget also the sore-
ness which the Athenians felt
on the subiect 01 Amphipolis,
so long a bone 01 0001601100
between themselves and Philip,
which would in some degree
extenuate the word otherwise so
invidious to 1116 national ear.
1 take this view 01 1116 passage
after much careiul considera-
tion. Some have altered the
text: others (amongst them
Schaefer) translate: ‘⁴ He had
reduced Amphipolis your city
(πόλιν) intovassalage‚ which then
(i.e. after the punishment 01
Timagoras) he wrote down as

natural that the king of Persia
should in these term-3 acknow-
ledge the Athenian claim over
the city? Besides there is some·
thing to my mind very forced
and harsh in this construction.
