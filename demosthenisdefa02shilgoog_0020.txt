Aeschines solely‚ the oratorical point, if meant, would
be lost without the addition of οὗτοι. Though Ι

Mr Paley doce, Ι am sure he would oblige the
critical world by publishing in the Journal a
complete collation.

Some readers may naturally ask why on occa-
sion of this re-issue I have once—and once only
— noticed an edition of the Speech, which sol-
lowed the publication of my third. To this question
I have a straightforward answer.

Ι had been told that a considerable part of the
volume alluded to was to be found in my own
notes. Ι had no care to inquire into this matter.

But when asked by my publishers to undertake
⁵ the revision of my work in its present form, I
became possessor of a copy of this contribution to
the “ Catena Classicorum.'’ My examination of the
first sheet seemed to support the rumour which
had reached me; and I confess that I thought it
a work of supererogation to add to my other occu-
pations the necessity of reading throughout a new
English edition of a Speech on which Ι had spent
-more or less—thirty years’ labour.
