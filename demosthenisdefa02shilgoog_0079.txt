to the latter, not only because
the repetition and emphatic
collocation of the pronoun
would else be idle, but in Philip
the Phocians are described as
placing no confidence, their
trust was onlyin the AthenianS,
and in Aeschines as an Athenian
This the whole tenour

ἓῖἶῗιζ· speech appears to me to
confirm. “ It wasin Aeschines

then that they placed their
whole confidence, it was to
Aeschines they entirely looked‚
it was with Aeschines they were
making the peace.’' The last
clause of course contains a
rhetorical exaggeration‚ but one
natural enough in the excite-
ment into which the Orator
throws himself with the view
of stirring up the vindictive
passions of his audience. Comp.

Moreover, in this sentence

fitly used of Philip, as 5 68

‘⁶ Paullisper hic insistit Orator,
quo magis appareat, 'quam
flagitiose Philippus fidem a
Phocensibus sibi habitam frus-
tratus sit.” Asis Demosthenes
did not design that the flayitium
of the deed should fall on the
head of Aeschines much more
than on Philip’s. In what fol-
lows he dwells on this most
forcibly. ἓ 71 κύριος εἷς ἀνὴρ

as again 5 74), ἓ 73 περὶ τῶν
