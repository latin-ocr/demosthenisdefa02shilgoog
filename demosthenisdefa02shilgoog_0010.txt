vi PREFACE.-

Critics, and not from the sources of Classical authore,
the well of Latin undefiled. Arnold in England and

Heindorf ² in Germany‚ either a host in himself,
have, amongst · others, broken through the trammels
of writing commentaries in a hybrid dialect of a dead
language. After forming the above expressed opi-
nion, which 1 came to not without mature reflection,
Ι proceeded some years ago to test it practically by
writing notes to a once contemplated edition of a
Greek Tragedy. Here Ι confess I was often per-
plexed: not that I found myself unable to express
my thoughts clearly in my own language upon gram-
·matical and otherwise exegetical matter: but Ι was
sadly at fault on any point purely critical for words
of a technical nature, if Ι may use the phrase, where
the traditionary Latin of Scholars had created in a
manner a vocabulary of its own. I accordingly, on
· some hundred lines of the Tragedy alluded to, wrote
notes in both English and Latin: and the result to
which after this process I came, was a deliberate per-
suasion that explanatory notes ought to be written in
one's own language, critical in the Latin. How far
Ι have accurately drawn the line between the two
classes of notes in the edition now placed before the
public, I will not venture to determine: but I can
add that several of the notes written originally in
Latin were, on second thoughtS, rewritten in English,
and vice versa. My time too has been far more
limited than I could have wished. I was applied to
