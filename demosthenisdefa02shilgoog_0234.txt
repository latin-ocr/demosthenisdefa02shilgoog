Aeschines prosecuted and de-
prived 01 1119 franchise one 01
1119 accusers. What is the re-
sult 01 this? To wit, he will
meet with no commiseration‚
no fellow-feeling at your hands.
N ay more, in his accusation he
chose 10 revile me. And what
is the result of this? 1 who
know his villanous conduct

better than any one shall meet
with your greater forbearance
in my conducting the present
prosecution than Ι otherwise
should have done, because as
one 01 1119 colleagues, the task
I have undertaken naturally is
somewhat invidious. Nay more:
he has by his artifices put off
the trial so long, that it has
fallen upon a most critical
period, at which, such are the
events that have occurred sub-
sequently to the embassy, you
cannot choose but condemn him
