to think she spoke all with truth.” As instances of 3,
compare Eur. Ion 1523 ὅρα, σύ, μῆτερ, μή σφαλεῖσ’ ἃ παρ-
θένοις Ι ἐγγίγνεται νοσήματ’ ἐς κρυπτοῧς γάμους, Ι ἔπειτα τῷ
θεῷ προστίθης τήν αἰτίαν, Ι καὶ τοῦμόν αῑσχρὸν ἀποφυγεῖν
πειρωμένη, Ι Φοίβῳ τεκεῖν με φῄς,τεκοῦσ’ οὐκ ἐκ θεοῦ. (With
Hermann's remarks on this passage Ι perfectly agree, that
any tense of the subjunctive whatever hae α future meaninq.
For Elmsley on Eur. Med. 310 strangely conceives the
use of the indicative aster μὴ is to be restricted praeteritis,
and more strangely that the subjunctive present has not a
future signification. See Hermann’s adnotat. on that
passage.) Op. Plat. Phaed. 7 7 D δεδιέναι τὸ τῶν παίδων,
μή ὦς ἀληθῶς ὁ ἄνεμος ...... διαφυσᾷ καὶ διασκεδάννυσιν, 84 Ε
φοβεῖσθε μὴ δυσκολώτερον διάκειμαι. Yet § 37¹7 of this
oration δέδοικα μή τούναντίον οὗ βούλομαι ποιῶ, σφόδρα
ἀκριβῶς δεικνύναι πειρώμενος, διοχλῶ ...... is certainly not
so clear. The sense might very well be: “I sear lest I
shall do,” (subjunctive), or “I sear that Ι am doing,'' (in-
dicative). If the former, compare de Ceron. p. 269 ἓ 125
ὅρα μὴ τούτων μὲν ε’χθρός ᾗς, ε’μός δὲ προσποιῇ· “Lesb you
be found to be.'' See Herm. on Med. 310 p. 356 Ed. Lipc.
I rather am inclined to understand it as an indicative.
Respecting the use of the perfect indicative all critics
agree. In § 3 of this speech ἐμπεποιήκῃ, the reading of
some MSS. and most editions, is faulty. For I quite
incline to Elmsley's opinion (Mus. Orit. 1. p. 356): “We
strongly suspect that if Demosthenes had employed the
subjunctive in this passage, he would have said ἐμπεποιη-
κός ᾗ. The Orators generally, if not alwayS, express this
subjunctive and its corresponding optative¹ by the auxi·
liary verb and the participle. Thus we find in the same
