As in preparing for the press my second issue of
Demosthenis de Falsa Leyatione Ι had before me
Dindorf’s Oxford Edition of our orator, so Ι have ¹in
revising the present had access to Bekker’s stereo-

the points of difference between these Editors and

myself. Bekker follows more closely than he for-

given by the Codex S„ while Voemel scarcely ever
departs from it ³. With due deference to these Cri-

aim rather having been to carefully revise the former
editions. Ι hope that Ι have so far been successful
as to leave no considerable amount of corrigenda.
