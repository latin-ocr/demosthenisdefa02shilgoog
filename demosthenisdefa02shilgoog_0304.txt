mood¹. The latter part' of the rule (μὴ following ὥστε
with the infinitive) appears occasionally to be violated. I
will first however, in passing, speak of the difference be·
tween the two modes of expression.

Matthiae, Gr. Gr. ἓ 629 n. c, remarks: “I have not yet
been able to satisfy myself whether any and what differ-
ence exists between the construction of ὥστε with an infi—
nitive and indicative. Hermann, ad Viger.‚ p. 852 n.,
352 b, seems to suppose an anacoluthon when ὥστε is
joined with an indicative.'' Hermann’s words are rather
tenebricosa, and may possibly not be rightly understood:
and I do not remember whether he has elsewhere ex-
plained himself more clearly. The difference seems simply
to be this: οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε οὐκ ἐβούλετο· “he was so
foolish that he did not wish,'' (expressive of the real
result or consequence). οὕτως ἄφρων ἦν ὥστε μὴ βούλε·
σθαι· “he was so foolish as netto wish,’' (expressive of the
natural consequence). In Latin the distinction might be
marked by translating the former, ut noluerit, the latter,
ut nollet. Now it is obvious that an energetic speaker,
wishing to express that the result (was not only of a
nature to follow, but) actually did follow, would employ
the indicative: whereas in ordinary and unimpassioned
language the infinitivo would imply all that was necessary,
the natural consequence supposing the real. Accordingly
in the Orators, much more frequently than in other
writers, the construction ὥστε or (ὥστε οὐ) with the indi-
cative occurs,
