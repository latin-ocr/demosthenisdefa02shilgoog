that a steady perusal of these
passages wiss lead us to adopt
the secondary meaning of‘ ‘to
squander, prodiyally waste? ” in
the sense ιιι which ἀναλῖσκειν
so frequently occurS. Had De-
mosthenes intended to say,

“This was the reason why they
were weaviny this web,’' why
did he not use ὑφαίνει-οἳ

355. 549. In the original
draught of the psephism, Philo-
crates had attempted to intro·
duce the clause πλήν Ἀλέων καὶ
Φωκέων, but the Athenians
would not hear of this exclusion
and compelled Philocrates ταῦ-

the psepffism, and substituting
others (εἶτα τὸ ψήφισμα ἐπεχεί-

ρησαν κινεῖν καὶ μεταίρειν) and, in ·

addition to Halus and Phocis,
of having declared Cersobleptes
also ἔκσπονδος. But “it appears
there was ground for a question
whether Cersobleptes was en-
titled to be considered an ally
of AthenS‚” Thirlw. v. 356. See
the somewhat prolix reply of
Aeschines, p. 38 —— 40 St.
:258—269 Β. Yet Auct. IV.
Philipp. p. 133 ἓ 8 expressly
calls Cersobleptes an ally: Κερ-
σοβλέπτην, σύμμαχον ὄντα ὑμῶν.
---ὅ σιωπᾶν καὶ ἐᾶν κ.τ.λ.]
“which fact (i. e. if they had
been exclud ed from the alliance)
it would have been natural they
should have held their peace
upon and passed over in silence,
had they wanted them not to
be destroyed.'' See the strange
mistranslation of Mitiord com-
mented upon by Thirlw. v 361,

ιι.2.
